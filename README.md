# Palmoria Group:
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in the Nigeria 

# Business Task
Palmoria group is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently published in the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy” This doesn’t look good for the owners of the business based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards revealing other issues like gender pay gap amongst other possible issues.

My job is to analyse the company’s HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention

## Questions to answer
What is the gender distribution in the organization?Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management

# Insights 
* Palmoria has 12 departments located in 3 regions: Kduna, abuja and lagos
* Palmoria has more male employees. Palmoria group has 946 employees, 441 females,465 males  and 40 generic genders 
* They pay the males $34,777,130 and females $31,811,840. This may also be due to the number of male employees she has.
* Kaduna region has the highest number of employees while lagos has the least number of employees
* Out of 12 departments, five pays the females more while seven pays the males more. The major reason being that there are more male employees than females.  
* Human resources department should be focused more on cause male employees are being paid more even with a higher number of female employees in the department.
* Kaduna pays her employees more than any other region. 
* Male employees are paid more in all regions. There are huge gender pay gaps in abuja and lagos.
* For positive ratings, female employees are rated higher than males
* For negative ratings, male ratings are more including the average ratings

# Recommendations
* The HR team should endeavour to pay female employees their honest dues, they are more rated than the male employees 
* Work on the poorly rated male employees to figure out the reason why they have such ratings and design a way to improve their ratings
* Employ more female employess for gender balance
